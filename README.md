## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. 🧩 Hardware Setup

#### Components Used:

* [Omni Wheel Round Chassis](https://robu.in/product/easymech-poly-omni-wheel-round-chassis/)
* [N20 12V 60RPM Micro Gear Motor](https://robu.in/product/n20-12v-60-rpm-micro-metal-gear-box-dc-motor/)
* A4988 Stepper Driver
* CNC Shield V3
* Arduino Uno
* L293D Motor Driver
* 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor
* Power supply (6V–12V recommended)
* Custom lightweight pen mount

#### Connections:

* Connect Arduino to CNC Shield V3.
* A4988 on the shield controls the stepper motor (pen Z-axis).
* L293D is used for driving N20 DC motors (X/Y movement).
* Supply 12V to the CNC shield via barrel jack.
* Follow detailed schematic in [`Hardware/Wiring_Diagram.png`](Hardware/Wiring_Diagram.png).

## 🧠 Software

### 2. 🔧 Arduino

Upload the GRBL firmware to Arduino Uno.

> 🔌 Use the `cnc_writer_grbl.ino` from [`Arduino_Code/`](Arduino_Code/) if you’re modifying GRBL or testing motors.

### 3. 🐍 Python Interface

Python script to send G-code commands to GRBL over serial.

```bash
python Python_Code/send_gcode.py
```

Modify the serial port and baud rate as required in the script.

## 📚 Project Notes

> Refer to [`Resources/Notes.md`](Resources/Notes.md) for hardware-related decisions, power supply concerns, and troubleshooting logs.

Key Observations:

* 28BYJ stepper motor needs to be tested with GRBL and A4988.
* Avoid powering motors with more than 12V without regulation.
* PWM affects DC motor speed — prefer consistent voltage if movement is jittery.
* Lightweight pen mount helps reduce z-axis load.
