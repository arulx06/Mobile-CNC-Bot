## üîß Hardware Setup Notes

* **Base Diameter**: 15.8 cm
* **Power Supply Options Checked**:

  * 15.6V and 33.4V were **not used** due to risk of damaging the motor driver.
  * Lower voltages (e.g., 3.4V vs 6.7V) showed noticeable speed differences.
* **Motor Types Used**:

  * N20 DC motors (for X/Y motion)
  * 28BYJ-48 stepper motor (tested for Z-axis control)
* **Motor Drivers**:

  * L293D for DC motor control (used previously on 4-wheel platform)
  * A4988 for stepper motor (on CNC shield)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Control Logic & Observations

* PWM causes speed issues with DC motors; a consistent voltage supply works better.
* For pen-lifting, reducing mechanical complexity (avoiding metal stands) helped in minimizing weight and improving stability.
* Using GRBL with LaserGRBL software allows easier G-code testing and visualization.

## üß™ Testing Instructions (Stepper Motor)

1. Connect Arduino Uno to CNC Shield V3.
2. Install A4988 driver module in correct orientation.
3. Connect stepper motor to the shield.
4. Power CNC shield with regulated 12V power supply.
5. Flash GRBL firmware to Arduino.
6. Test motion using LaserGRBL or Arduino serial monitor.

## üß† Key Design Choices

* Opted for omni wheels to allow multi-directional movement.
* Used a mobile platform instead of a fixed base for portability.
* Replaced heavy pen-lift components with a lighter solution (see [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/og1506q67mo?si=HX_Q6KzTD76h4BOH)).

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting Log

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **PWM issues**: Avoid using PWM for N20 motors‚Äîresults in speed fluctuations.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Power mismatches**: Higher voltage power supplies caused risk to L293D‚Äîstick to <=12V regulated sources.
* ‚úÖ **L293D confirmation**: Earlier confusion about L293D was resolved‚Äîit does work for N20 motors if current is within limits.
